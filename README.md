Implementation of CHATBOT using NLP
📘 Overview
This project focuses on building a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The chatbot can understand user input, recognize intent, and provide meaningful responses. It utilizes popular libraries like NLTK, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit to achieve this goal. The chatbot's responses are defined in a structured JSON file, which makes it easy to add, update, or modify the bot's behavior.

🛠️ Features
Intent Recognition: Detects user intent (greetings, farewells, questions, etc.) and responds accordingly.
Customizable Intents: Easily modify or expand queries and responses via a JSON file.
Interactive Web Interface: Users can chat with the bot in real time through a Streamlit web app.
Response Generation: Generates accurate and contextually appropriate responses.
Conversation History: Logs user conversations for analysis and improvement.
💻 Technologies Used
Python: Core language used for the development of the chatbot.
NLTK: For tokenization, lemmatization, stemming, and text processing.
Scikit-learn: Used for machine learning models to classify user intents.
Streamlit: Interactive, browser-based user interface.
JSON: Used to store intent data, including patterns and responses.
📥 Installation Instructions
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-folder>
2️⃣ Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
3️⃣ Install Required Packages
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4️⃣ Download Required NLTK Data
python
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
🚀 How to Run
Run the following command to launch the chatbot:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This will open the Streamlit web application where users can interact with the chatbot in real time. Type a message in the input box, press Enter, and see the chatbot's response displayed.

🛠️ How the Chatbot Works
User Input: The user enters a message through the web app.
NLP Processing: The input is processed to identify intent, entities, and keywords.
Response Generation: The system generates a response based on patterns and responses stored in the intents.json file.
Response Display: The chatbot displays the response in the Streamlit interface.
Logging: User interactions are stored for further analysis.
📝 Intents File (intents.json)
The intents.json file defines how the chatbot responds to different user inputs. Each intent includes a tag, a set of patterns (user inputs), and a list of possible responses.
📈 Conversation History
Every user interaction is saved in a file named chat_log.csv. This file keeps a log of the user's message, the system's response, and the date/time of the interaction. It can be useful for:

Debugging: Identifying where the chatbot failed to understand user input.
Performance Analysis: Reviewing how well the chatbot handled various inputs.
System Improvement: Using chat history as training data for future improvements.
🔧 Customization
Want to customize the bot's responses? You can modify the intents.json file. Add new intents or edit patterns and responses as needed.
