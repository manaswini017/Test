# AI Powered Conversational Chatbot 

## Overview
## Project Description

This project implements an intelligent chatbot leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The primary goal is to build a system capable of understanding user queries, determining their intent, and providing contextually relevant responses. By utilizing libraries such as `nltk` for language processing, `scikit-learn` for machine learning, and `streamlit` for the user interface, the chatbot aims to create a smooth and interactive experience for users.

---

## Features
- Understands various user intents such as greetings, farewells, gratitude, and more.
- Provides relevant responses based on user input.
- Maintains a conversation history that can be viewed by the user.
- Built using Python and leverages popular libraries for NLP and machine learning.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **NLTK**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Streamlit**
- **JSON** for intents data

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download NLTK Data
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
```

---

## Usage
To run the chatbot application, execute the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Once the application is running, you can interact with the chatbot through the web interface. Type your message in the input box and press Enter to see the chatbot's response.

---

## Intents Data
The chatbot's behavior is defined by the `intents.json` file, which contains various tags, patterns, and responses. You can modify this file to add new intents or change existing ones.

---

## Conversation History
The chatbot saves the conversation history in a CSV file (`chat_log.csv`). You can view past interactions by selecting the "Conversation History" option in the sidebar.

## Future Work
While this chatbot demonstrates basic functionality, future work could include adding more advanced conversational abilities such as handling multi-turn conversations, improving intent detection, or using deep learning techniques for response generation. Additionally, the integration of more complex language models like GPT could improve the quality and fluidity of the responses.
